"""Helper for reporting handled exceptions to Sentry/Bugsink + OTel.

Use this at any except-block site that intentionally turns an exception into
a graceful user-facing error result (a ``ToolError``, a TUI message, a logged
warning). The site keeps its existing failure-rendering behaviour; the helper
additionally informs the monitoring stack so dashboards can see the failure
rate, class, and bucket.

Privacy posture
---------------
Only pass primitive enum-like attributes through ``**attrs`` (tool name,
class names, mode flags). The OTel ``error`` event is forwarded verbatim, so
**never** pass user input, file paths, or code snippets there. Sentry is fine
with full exception data — its ``before_send`` hook already scrubs paths and
strips PII before transmission.

Both forwarding paths are wrapped in :func:`contextlib.suppress` because
telemetry must never break the host program.
